The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing and digital marketing.  Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call centres are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call.  You are provided with the client data such as : age of the client, their job type, their marital status, etc. Along with the client data, you are also provided with the information of the call such as the duration of the call, day and month of the call, etc. Given this information, your task is to predict if the client will subscribe to term deposit.
